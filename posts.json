        "content": "After the events that took place in a city that\u2019s just a bit too close to home yesterday, I am consistently reminded of the fear that going even to the grocery store might be my last day on Earth. Not only that, but that it could be my wife or child\u2019s last day too. And not only THAT, but\r\nthe odds are I would be vanquished by a gun wielding lunatic blowing my brains across the sidewalk for the world to see, because you know, that\u2019s just what bullets do. \r\n\r\nThe videos and images spread across Twitter and everywhere else are graphic, and as they should be, because that is the reality of what could happen at any given point going out into the community today. It could just have easily been Target here in town, or any of the other dozen stores me and my family frequently visit on the weekends. \r\n\r\nOverall, I\u2019m fucking sick of it. I\u2019m sick of everything in this state, this country, this land of \u201cfreedom\u201d as it\u2019s known to be called. I\u2019ve been looking at the perspective of moving, out of country even, but that instantly becomes a pipe dream because the logistics just don\u2019t work in my favor. I feel stranded in fear. I feel confined in uncertainty. I feel anger and regret for falling into this trap of an American dream that is truly a nightmare. I don\u2019t want to live here anymore.\r\n\n\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s been a busy day from the moment I woke up at the ass crack of 5:30 a.m. I went into work feeling ready to take on the day, yet I didn\u2019t realize how focused in I would be on this project, and I unintentionally came across uninterested in anything else that was presented to me; work related or not. In other words, I came across as a dick to anyone that tried to conversate with me and hopefully those folks that attempted to gain my attention don\u2019t take it personally.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been feeling some kind of way lately, and I\u2019m having trouble understanding what that feeling is. The same feeling tends to come often, and typically, I can\u2019t stand it. This time, however, I\u2019m trying a different approach to embrace it and give in so I can see what\u2019s on the other side. I\u2019m just, like, in this new headspace where all of life has meaning, and every little thing I do makes a difference. Not that it actually does, but damn; it sure feels that way. \r\n\r\nIt could just be getting older, my kid getting older, my never-ending pursuit of knowledge and wisdom that will never be fulfilled, but who-the-fuck knows. I sure as shit don\u2019t, lol. Either way, I\u2019m going to ride out whatever this is, and let my gut take the wheel rather than a 12-pack. Oh wait! I know what it is, it\u2019s depression! Seasonal depression! Ahh, yes, that\u2019s it! Take that, you dumb fuckin\u2019 brain I figured you out. \r\n\r\nWell, so much for a post. Sure, this isn\u2019t as thought out as I\u2019d like for it to be, but my rambles are my truth.\r\n\n",

        "content": "It's been a pretty good weekend. I played a show with the band yesterday at Toyota Music Factory in Dallas. It was a great because the wife and the boy got to come; it was Benji's first time getting to see us play, let alone see his dad play so that was awesome.\r\n\r\nAs for today, it's just the typical Sunday chores and getting ready for the upcoming work week, along with a rack of ribs smoking on the Traeger. And as for work, it's been a bit stale in terms of cool projects to work on and, well, anything new really - it's been report after report after report here lately. However, I am always learning more with Power BI and new ways to extract, manipulate, and visualize data, and that should be my takeaway. As he always does, the director will swoop by our desks any day now with some new grand idea, so I shouldn\u2019t let a week or two of report building put a damper on the work life.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m hoping to get some time this week to work on the site a little bit more, I have some ideas for new stylings and pages that I think will make it even more badass than it already is! We\u2019re talking list items, images in posts, gifs in posts, videos in posts, etc. I started the site with the idea of it being solely text, but of course that\u2019s evolving into something much more. I also plan to throw up some more doodles in the next few days while I continue to clean and organize my home office.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s it for the first Shitpost Sunday, there will be many more to come.\r\n\r\n-Dad\r\n\n\n",

I added a new table to my Postgres database to store my image links and made a script that will manage my images in the database. Things are starting to come together at hi-dad.lol I tell ya!\n\nI've been doing some more editing to the CSS stylings of this thing and added a nav burger bar. If you click the burger, you'll be able to navigate to the archive and to the newly added 'Doodles' page as well.\n\n",

        "content": "Drake made headlines when he spoke out on AI after an AI generated song went viral featuring his voice over a track by some lady called Ice Spice. He stated, \"This is the final straw AI...\" as if he was personally taking on an AI model in a rap battle. However, it's clear that AI-generated music is only going to become a common trend, and it may give the average person the power to create hit songs without spending tons of money on studio recording. Whether this is a good thing or not isn\u2019t for me to decide. You could argue that it takes away from the creativity and artistry of the music industry, while regular folks see it as a way to get their own recognition. I was informed the other day by [JCN](https://www.jcnoel.dev) that over 1 million songs are released each year, so I can only expect that number to increase dramatically with AI generated music becoming more readily available to creators. Regardless, AI is taking a toll on the creative industry. I can only imagine more artists will be coming out against AI generated music, and it will be interesting to see how this trend plays out in the coming weeks and months. As for me, I can't help but find it all a bit hilarious.\n\n",

Off to the garage for a toke, and then its lego time. \n\n-Peace\n",
